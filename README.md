# Introduction
This is a dataset that contains movie details from IMDb, such as title, release year, director, income, and so on. In the original dataset, there are errors, empty rows and columns, inconsistencies, invalid data types and much more to clean up before the final product can be used for analysis and drawing accurate insights.

# Business Problem
The dataset cannot be used for analysis as it is, we want to clean it up, properly format the columns, and make sure the data is valid, in order for it to be used to solve or answer business questions.

# Aim
The aim of cleaning this dataset is to make sure the data is in the proper format, consistent, properly organised and clean enough to be useful to IMDb or whichever third party needs to use the data. We want to
- Eliminate Errors.
- Eliminate Redundancy.
-Increase Data Reliability.
- Deliver Accuracy.
- Ensure Consistency.
